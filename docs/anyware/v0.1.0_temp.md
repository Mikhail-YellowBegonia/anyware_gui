# Anyware v0.1.0 Temporary Notes

Last Updated: 2026-02-15
Scope: short-lived scratchpad for decisions/actions toward Anyware v0.1.0. After decisions settle, merge into `anyware_plan.md` and/or `GUI_FRAMEWORK.md`.

## Immediate (Actionable)
1. Implement `CheckboxMenu` (MVP component)
- Target: `core/anyware/widgets.py` (or new `core/anyware/menus.py` if it stays clean).
- Needs: focus wiring, selected state model, deterministic nav links, manual line breaks for labels.
- Demo: add a small `CheckboxMenu` block into `apps/app_anyware_demo.py`.

2. Close + archive DSKY test
- Manual retest is OK.
- Mark `GUI-DSKY-RETEST` as Done and move DSKY integration artifacts under an archive folder (keep runnable but not “active test”).
- No further DSKY work is blocking Anyware v0.1.0.

3. SegmentDisplay global defaults/theme
- Add a simple global default layer so apps stop repeating `digit_w_px/digit_h_px/spacing_px/on_color/off_color`.
- Keep it tiny: one place to set defaults, plus per-instance overrides.
- Add a small Anyware-side unit test to assert defaults are applied.

## Needs Discussion (Do Not Implement Yet)
Dynamic system / “content changes” model (HTML/Dom-like idea)
- Problem statement:
  - UIs need content updates (values change, labels change, visible/enabled toggles, page swaps).
  - Developers (and AI) will iterate layout + bindings heavily, so “live feedback loop” matters.
- Question:
  - Do we want a DOM-like tree + reconciliation model in Anyware, or keep the current imperative component objects and standardize “bindings”?

Candidate directions (to decide):
1. Minimal bindings (recommended baseline for 0.1.0)
- Standardize `Bindable[T] = T | Callable[[ctx], T]` for common props (text, color, visible, enabled).
- Resolve per-frame (cheap, deterministic), no diff engine.
- Page remains Python objects; state is stored in page/component fields or a simple `ctx.store` dict.

2. Declarative “DOM-ish” tree with reconcile (larger jump)
- Page returns an element tree each frame (or on changes).
- Runtime reconciles: mount/unmount/update focus nodes and component instances automatically.
- Pros: hot swap layouts/modules cleanly; AI output can be closer to “data = UI”.
- Cons: significantly more framework work; risk to schedule.

Decision inputs we need from you:
- For v0.1.0, do you want “bindings only” first, or commit to “DOM-ish reconcile” now?
- Do you want live reload to be only “layout params” (current), or “page module reload + rebuild UI tree” too?
