Integration Test Prompt (DSKY GUI Reproduction)
Status: Temporary guidance for AI coding challenge

Goal
- Recreate the Apollo DSKY interface layout using Anyware (raw GUI allowed).
- Prioritize layout fidelity and interaction placeholders over full functionality.

Guidance (keep it short in the implementation)
- Use grid-first layout; convert to pixels only for shapes.
- Use Anyware components where possible: Label, Button, SegmentDisplay, MeterBar/DialGauge if helpful.
- SegmentDisplay: only 7-seg digits + decimal point.
- Buttons: use Button with pressable/focusable; status lights are non-pressable buttons with status fill.
- Keep Page logic minimal: single page or PageRouter with explicit switch only.

Layout hints (visual)
- Top row: two panels; left is status list, right is numeric display.
- Bottom: keypad matrix with labeled buttons.
- Keep margins consistent; use thick borders for panel frames.

Integration test rules
- Avoid deep app logic; show placeholders for states.
- Deterministic rendering: no randomness, no time-based animations.
- Use a single entrypoint script under apps/ for the test.
