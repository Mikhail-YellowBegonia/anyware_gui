Anyware is a UI toolbox based on this GUI project, It shall contian a variety of fundemental UI contents and logics.
It should provide UI contents like buttons/slidebars etc.
It should have built-in arrow-key navigation and cursor/input support
It should apply class methods rather than function methods, to simplify codebase and adapt to complex & dynamic layouts
It should insist on fixed grid coordinates layout, rather than html-like flexible layouts
It might provide optional LLM/voice-to-text/text-to-voice functions to build natural language human-computer interaction
It's based directly upon the GUI.py and other misc libraries.

We hope that novice programmers can use Anyware to create retro GUI interfaces with productivity and comfort comparable to simple HTML-based web page creation.
